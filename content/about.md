## Download and place it on your webserver.

You can download the certificate in various popular formats, like PEM, PKCS12 or DER. Place it on your webserver or loadbalancer and you are good to go live. 

## How could you acquire certificates to my domain?

In order to be the SSL session trusted, you will need to reach your site using our special hostnames. Using these hostnames our DNS servers will generate responses pointing straight to your site. No hidden secrets, no eavesdropping or any kind of traffic, no diverting or proxying. This service simply generates valid DNS type `A` and `CNAME` records for your project to be covered with the `*.qssl.org` wildcard certificate that you can download from this site.
